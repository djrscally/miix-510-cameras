Subject: [PATCH 05/13] software_node: Alter software_node_unregister_nodes()
 to unregister the array in reverse order

Software nodes that are children of another software node should be
unregistered before their parent. To allow easy unregistering of an array
of software_nodes ordered parent to child, reverse the order in which
this function unregisters software_nodes.
